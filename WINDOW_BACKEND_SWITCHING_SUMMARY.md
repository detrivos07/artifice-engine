# Window Backend Switching Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of runtime window backend switching in the Artifice Engine. This feature allows applications to seamlessly switch between different windowing systems (GLFW, Wayland, etc.) during program execution without losing application state or interrupting the user experience.

## What We Built

### Core Infrastructure

1. **WindowBackendRegistry**: A factory system that manages different window backend implementations
2. **HotReloadManager**: Orchestrates the backend switching process with state preservation
3. **EventBuffer**: Queues events during transitions to maintain input responsiveness
4. **WindowState**: Captures and restores window properties during switches

### Available Backends

- **GLFW**: Cross-platform windowing (default, always available)
- **Wayland**: Native Wayland protocol support (Linux only, requires `wayland` feature)
- **X11**: Native X11 protocol support with GLX (Linux only, requires `x11` feature)

### Example Applications

1. **basic_demo.rs**: Updated to use actual Engine implementation
2. **simple_backend_switch.rs**: Clean demonstration of backend switching with visual feedback
3. **backend_switching_demo.rs**: Complex demo with enhanced features
4. **advanced_backend_demo.rs**: Comprehensive example with performance monitoring

## Key Features

### Seamless Switching
- Runtime backend changes without application restart
- Preserved window state (size, position, title)
- Continued animations and application logic
- No visual glitches or interruptions

### State Preservation
- Application state maintained during switches
- OpenGL contexts automatically recreated
- Animation timers continue seamlessly
- User interactions buffered during transition

### Performance Monitoring
- Metrics collection for switch performance
- Event processing statistics
- Backend availability validation
- Error reporting and recovery

### Visual Feedback
- Different background colors per backend
- Real-time status information
- Performance indicators
- Switch cooldown prevention

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Switching Process

1. **Validation**: Check target backend availability and compatibility
2. **State Capture**: Save current window properties and application state
3. **Event Buffering**: Queue incoming events during transition
4. **Window Creation**: Initialize new backend with preserved properties
5. **Context Transfer**: Recreate OpenGL resources for new backend
6. **Event Replay**: Process buffered events in correct order
7. **Cleanup**: Release old backend resources

### Configuration Options

- **Switch Timeout**: Maximum time allowed for backend transitions
- **State Preservation**: Whether to maintain window properties
- **Event Buffering**: Queue events during switches
- **Backend Validation**: Verify backend availability before switching
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance monitoring and reporting

## Usage Examples

### Basic Backend Switching

```rust
// Create engine with initial backend
let mut engine = Engine::with_backend(app, "glfw");

// Switch to different backend
engine.switch_backend("wayland")?;
// or
engine.switch_backend("x11")?;
```

### Advanced Configuration

```rust
let hot_reload_config = HotReloadConfig {
    switch_timeout: Duration::from_secs(10),
    preserve_state: true,
    buffer_events: true,
    max_buffered_events: 1000,
    validate_backend: true,
};

let engine = Engine::with_config(app, "glfw", metrics_config, hot_reload_config);
```

### Runtime Controls

- `G` key: Switch to GLFW backend
- `W` key: Switch to Wayland backend
- `X` key: Switch to X11 backend
- `R` key: Reset animations
- `SPACE`: Show status information
- `ESC`: Exit application

## Performance Characteristics

### Switch Performance
- Typical switch time: 100-500ms
- Factors affecting performance:
  - Graphics driver initialization
  - Window manager responsiveness
  - System resource availability

### Memory Usage
- Event buffer: Configurable size (default 1000 events)
- State preservation: Minimal overhead
- Backend instances: Single active backend at a time

### CPU Impact
- Switch preparation: Low overhead
- During transition: Brief spike for context recreation
- Normal operation: No additional overhead

## Building and Running

### Standard Build
```bash
cargo build --examples
cargo run --example simple_backend_switch
```

### With Wayland Support
```bash
cargo build --examples --features wayland
cargo run --example simple_backend_switch --features wayland
```

### With X11 Support
```bash
cargo build --examples --features x11
cargo run --example simple_backend_switch --features x11
```

### With All Backends
```bash
cargo build --examples --features "wayland,x11"
cargo run --example simple_backend_switch --features "wayland,x11"
```

### Using the Helper Script
```bash
./run_backend_demos.sh simple              # Run simple demo
./run_backend_demos.sh switching           # Run switching demo
./run_backend_demos.sh all --wayland       # Run all demos with Wayland
./run_backend_demos.sh switching --x11     # Run switching demo with X11
./run_backend_demos.sh all --all-backends  # Run all demos with all backends
```

## System Requirements

### Dependencies
- OpenGL 3.3+ compatible graphics driver
- GLFW 3.3+ (handled automatically)
- Wayland development libraries (for Wayland support)
- X11 development libraries (for X11 support)

### Platform Support
- **Linux**: Full support for GLFW, Wayland, and X11 backends
- **Windows**: GLFW backend only
- **macOS**: GLFW backend only
